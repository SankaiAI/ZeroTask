# Claude Code Rules for ZeroTask

## PRD Governance

### üîí PRD Lock Policy
- **PRD.md is IMMUTABLE once development starts** (post v0.1.0)
- No modifications to PRD.md allowed after project launch
- All scope changes must go through proper change management process

### üìã Pre-Development Checklist
Before writing any code, Claude must:
1. ‚úÖ Read and understand the complete PRD.md
2. ‚úÖ Verify all requirements are clear and implementable
3. ‚úÖ Identify any ambiguities or missing details
4. ‚úÖ Request clarification from user if needed
5. ‚úÖ Confirm PRD is complete and ready for implementation

### üîÑ Scope Change Process
If Claude identifies need for scope changes during development:

1. **STOP coding immediately**
2. Document the proposed change with:
   - Current requirement (from PRD)
   - Proposed new requirement
   - Justification for change
   - Impact assessment (timeline, complexity)
3. Request user approval for scope change
4. If approved, update CHANGELOG.md with:
   - Version bump (following semantic versioning)
   - Detailed change description in appropriate section
   - Reference to original PRD requirement
5. Only proceed with implementation after changelog is updated

## Development Rules

### üéØ Implementation Fidelity
- Implement exactly what's specified in PRD.md
- No feature creep or "improvements" without explicit approval
- Follow architecture decisions specified in PRD
- Respect non-goals and MVP limitations

### üìù Documentation Standards
- All code changes must reference PRD sections (e.g., "Implements PRD 5.1 Connectors")
- Use CHANGELOG.md format for all change documentation
- Include impact assessment for any deviations
- Maintain traceability between code and requirements

### üö® Exception Handling
If Claude encounters technical blockers during implementation:
1. Document the blocker and attempted solutions
2. Propose alternative approaches that maintain PRD compliance
3. Request user guidance before deviating from PRD specifications
4. Update changelog if alternative approach is approved

## Quality Gates

### Before Each Milestone
- [ ] All PRD requirements for milestone implemented
- [ ] No undocumented scope changes
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes
- [ ] Code matches PRD architecture decisions
- [ ] Acceptance criteria from PRD verified

### Code Review Standards
- Reference specific PRD sections in commit messages
- Verify implementation matches PRD specifications
- Check that data engineering requirements (Section 7) are followed
- Ensure no scope creep beyond defined MVP boundaries

## Available Specialized Agents

### üé® ui-ux-designer
**Use for**: Daily brief UI, card layouts, action buttons, responsive design
**ZeroTask Context**: PRD Section 10 (UX Flows), card component design, accessibility
**Example**: "Design the daily brief card component following PRD UX specifications"

### üèóÔ∏è backend-system-architect  
**Use for**: API architecture, OAuth flows, service design, scalability planning
**ZeroTask Context**: PRD Section 8 (Architecture), connector design, security patterns
**Example**: "Review the FastAPI + SQLite architecture for ZeroTask following PRD specs"

### üîí data-pipeline-security-engineer
**Use for**: Data deduplication, encryption, compliance, pipeline monitoring
**ZeroTask Context**: PRD Section 7 (Data Engineering Requirements), token security
**Example**: "Implement secure token storage following PRD privacy requirements"

## Agent Usage Protocol
1. **Consult agents for domain expertise** on complex implementations
2. **Always reference PRD sections** when calling agents
3. **Agents must follow PRD constraints** (local-first, privacy, MVP scope)
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** if agent recommendations require scope changes
5. **Integrate agent guidance** with overall ZeroTask architecture

## Development Environment Setup

### üêç Python Backend Environment
**CRITICAL**: Always activate the Python virtual environment before running backend code or tests.

**Windows Command:**
```bash
cd zerotask-backend && venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Required before ANY backend operations:**
- Installing Python packages (`pip install`)
- Running FastAPI server (`uvicorn app.main:app`)
- Running database migrations (`alembic upgrade head`)
- Running backend tests (`pytest`)
- Any Python script execution

### üåê Frontend Environment
**Frontend runs in Node.js (no virtual environment needed):**
```bash
cd zerotask-frontend && npm run dev
```

## Environment Validation
Before coding, Claude must verify:
1. ‚úÖ Backend venv is activated (check for `(venv)` in terminal prompt)
2. ‚úÖ Frontend dependencies are installed (`node_modules/` exists)
3. ‚úÖ Required services running (Ollama for LLM, database accessible)

## Enforcement
- Claude will refuse to implement features not in PRD without proper change process
- All scope discussions must result in CHANGELOG.md updates before coding
- PRD.md remains the single source of truth for project requirements
- User approval required for any deviations from PRD specifications
- Specialized agents must maintain PRD compliance in their recommendations
- **Claude must activate Python venv before any backend operations**
